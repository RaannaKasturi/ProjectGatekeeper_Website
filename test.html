        The `CRLReason` enumeration defines various reasons for revoking a digital certificate. Each reason indicates a
        specific scenario that necessitates the revocation. Hereâ€™s a detailed explanation of each reason:
    </p>
    <div>
        <h3>1. Unspecified (0)</h3>
        <p>
            This reason is used when the revocation does not fall into any of the other specified categories. It may be
            employed when the exact cause of revocation is not disclosed or is not applicable to the defined reasons.
        </p>
    </div>
    <div>
        <h3>2. Key Compromise (1)</h3>
        <p>
            This reason indicates that the private key associated with the certificate has been compromised. The
            compromise could be due to theft, loss, or unauthorized access. When this occurs, the certificate authority
            (CA) must revoke the certificate immediately to prevent misuse of the compromised key. The CA is also
            expected to update the revocation date to reflect when the compromise was determined, even if it predates
            the revocation request.</p>
    </div>
    <div>
        <h3>3. CA Compromise</h3>
        <p>
            This reason is used when the certificate authority's private key has been compromised. If a CA's key is
            compromised, all certificates issued by that CA may be considered untrustworthy, and the CA must revoke
            those certificates to maintain the integrity of the trust chain.</p>
    </div>
    <div>
        <h3>4. Affiliation Changed (3)</h3>
        <p>
            This reason applies when the subject's name or identity information in the certificate has changed, but
            there is no suspicion of key compromise. It is typically used when the certificate subscriber requests
            revocation due to changes in their organization or other identity-related information.</p>
    </div>
    <div>
        <h3>5. Superseded (4)</h3>
        <p>
            This reason is used when a certificate has been replaced by a newer certificate. The newer certificate may
            contain updated information or enhanced security features. The superseded certificate is revoked to prevent
            confusion and ensure that only the latest certificate is in use.
        </p>
    </div>
    <div>
        <h3>6. Cessation of Operation (5)</h3>
        <p>
            This reason indicates that the certificate subscriber has ceased operations. This could apply to
            organizations that are no longer in business or have stopped using the services for which the certificate
            was issued. Revocation ensures that the certificate cannot be misused after the organization has closed.
        </p>
    </div>
    <div>
        <h3>7. Certificate Hold (6)</h3>
        <p>
            This reason is used when a certificate is temporarily put on hold. This could be due to a pending
            investigation or verification process. While on hold, the certificate is not considered valid for use, but
            it may be reinstated later if the issues are resolved.
        </p>
    </div>
    <div>
        <h3>8. Remove from CRL (8)</h3>
        <p>
            This reason is used to indicate that a certificate is being removed from the Certificate Revocation List
            (CRL) for reasons other than those specified above. It may be used in cases where a certificate was revoked
            in error or has been re-evaluated and found to be valid.
        </p>
    </div>
    <div>
        <h3>10. AA Compromise (10)</h3>
        <p>
            This reason indicates that the authority that issued the certificate (such as an issuing authority or a
            subordinate CA) has been compromised. Similar to CA compromise, this can affect the trustworthiness of
            certificates issued by that authority.
        </p>
